# Thrombosis Research 


## Overview 

This project focuses on analyzing Thrombosis, a common collagen disease, using historical data provided by the Georgetown University's hospital. The data provided was intentionally messy, as the aim of this project is to analyze messy data and still come up with meaninfgul insights. The end goal of this project was to convince large research organizations to provide appropriate funding for a larger scale study on Thrombosis.

Concepts:

* Exploratory Data Visualizations.
* Dealing with messy and low quality data.
* Generating professional reports with Quarto.

File Structure:

* Report.ipynb: Jupyter notebook will all code
* Report.qmd: A quarto document that implements code in website form
* Report.html: A rendered final report in HTML format
* medical-data-decription: A pdf description of every medical variable used
